ROS-Industrial Special Project: 6D tool path planner

[Pierre Étienne Bézier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier) September 1, 1910 – November 25, 1999; *was a French engineer and one of the founders of the fields of solid, geometric and physical modeling as well as in the field of representing curves, especially in CAD/CAM systems. As an engineer at Renault, he became a leader in the transformation of design and manufacturing, through mathematics and computing tools, into computer-aided design and three-dimensional modeling. Bézier patented and popularized, but did not invent the Bézier curves and Bézier surfaces that are now used in most computer-aided design and computer graphics systems.*

General information
-------------------
This project has been developed by the [Institut Maupertuis](http://www.institutmaupertuis.fr), a French research institute that is working on robotic industrial processes.
This project goal is to create an automatic grinding path generator for 6-axis robots working on diverse/random meshes.

Bezier planner generates robot poses (3D trajectories) in harmony with a grinding process.
It is able to create rectilinear trajectories on complicated surfaces (3D surfaces) and to dilate them in all directions in order to grind defects with a pass principle.

Directories in the project
--------------------------

| Directory  | Description
------------ | -----------
`bezier` | Meta-package
`bezier_application` | Example usage of the `bezier_library` for grinding operations on a Fanuc R-1000iA robot.
`bezier_library` | Library containing several path planning algorithms

Dependencies
------------
- [Robot Operating System](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
- [`industrial-core`](http://wiki.ros.org/industrial_core)
- [`fanuc`](https://github.com/InstitutMaupertuis/fanuc) :warning: Joint limits have been tweaked
- [`fanuc experimental`](https://github.com/InstitutMaupertuis/fanuc_experimental) :warning: Joint limits have been tweaked
- [`Visualization Toolkit`](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/) version `7.0` or later
- [`Point Cloud Library`](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) version `1.8.0` or later. :warning: PCL has to be compiled against the same VTK version that is used for this package.
- `C++11` is required 

This package has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo.

Quick help
----------

**Build**

Clone this repository into your catkin source folder and build the workspace:
```bash
cd $(catkin_workspace)/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/bezier.git
```

**Launch**
```bash
roslaunch bezier_application bezier_application_r1000ia.launch meshname:=plane/plane.ply surface:=on
```

In this example, `bezier_application` will be launched with `oriented_complicated_mesh.ply` as input mesh and `oriented_complicated_mesh_defect.ply` as default mesh. Moreover, the grinding will be done in surface mode, meaning that we only pass on the surface of the mesh to smooth it.

Others examples of meshes are available in:
```bash
$(catkin_workspace)/src/bezier/bezier_application/meshes
```
